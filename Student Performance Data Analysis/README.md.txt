# Student Performance Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data using Python and machine learning techniques.  
The main goal is to understand how different factors affect student success and to predict final performance scores.

The project is implemented in a single Python script and automatically creates a dataset if no CSV file is found.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains student-related information such as:
- Study time
- Attendance rate
- Previous exam scores
- Final performance score

If the dataset file does not exist, the program automatically generates a synthetic dataset (`student_performance.csv`).

## Project Workflow
1. Dataset loading or automatic generation
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Feature engineering
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation using R² score

## Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

Feature engineering improved the model performance by approximately **12% (R² score)**.
